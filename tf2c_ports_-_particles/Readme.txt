Description: I started porting stuff from Team Fortress 2 Classic (A sourcemod based off TF2) a few years ago, but never had the chance to release them until now. This is one of the stuff that I've done from porting stuff from TF2C: Particles.

This mod replaces particles including but not limited to explosions, flame effects, rocket trails, explosions, grenade and stickybomb effects, etc.

Installation Instructions:

Extract the VPK file or the folder to your Team Fortress 2's "custom" folder.
(Steam/SteamApps/common/Team Fortress 2/tf/custom)

The folder version allows much more customization than the optimized VPK one. For example, you can remove anything you don't want or need, such as rocket effects, muzzleflash, blood, etc.

===========================================================================

Uninstallation Instructions:

Simply delete the VPK/folder in your 'Team Fortress 2\tf\custom'
directory. The game will then resume using the original particle effects stored in the VPK files.
